The Gist of this...
If we can create a model of your application, then we can generate a large amount of source code automatically. The source code generated can be for many different language (.net, python, etc.) and for many diffierent application types (Web, IOS App, Android App, Augmented Reality App, Virtual Reality App, etc.). Once generated, you can pull in any of the generated source code you like into your own source code repository. 

Steps...

1. Start a new Model
- Go to menu item: File > New

2. Add Model Features 
- Go to menu item: Services > Add Model Feature
- Add pre-configured features to your model to get a head start. They are added during the 'AI Processing' Phase.

3. Make any other changes to the model, using this GUI.

4. Send the model to ‘Model Services - AI Processing’. This will attempt to add many details to your model automatically.
- Go to menu item: Services > AI Processing
- Make a request, wait till compelted, then load the results.

5. Send the model to ‘Model Services - Validation’ to check for any errors.
- Go to menu item: Services > Validation
- Make a request, wait till compelted, then verify success.

6. Send the model to ‘Model Services - Fabrication’ to build the source code. The results will be a zip file full of source code.
- Go to menu item: Services > Fabrication
- Make a request, wait till compelted, then download the results. 

7. Repeat 2-6 to keep adding source code.
